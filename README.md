This project is built on top of [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue).

And it depends on:
- [electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) Build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- [vue](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) A progressive, incrementally-adoptable JavaScript framework for building UI on the web.
- [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue) An Electron & Vue.js quick start boilerplate with vue-cli scaffolding, common Vue plugins, electron-packager/electron-builder, unit/e2e testing, vue-devtools, and webpack.
- [request](https://github.com/request/request) Simplified HTTP request client.
- [sudo-prompt](https://github.com/jorangreef/sudo-prompt) Run a command using sudo, prompting the user with an OS dialog if necessary.
- [compare-versions](https://github.com/omichelsen/compare-versions) Compare semver version strings to find which is greater, equal or lesser.
- [auto-launch](https://github.com/Teamwork/node-auto-launch) Launch applications or executables at login (Mac, Windows, and Linux)
